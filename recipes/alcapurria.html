        <p>Alcapurrias are famous Puerto Rican stuffed fritters most commonly served in road-side stands 
            and in cafeterias that specialize in fried snacks, called cuchifritos. 
            The dough of the alcapurria is made from a starchy vegetable, either mashed green 
            plantains or grated yuca, and then stuffed with a savory mixture of ground meat or pork.
             The dough is formed into a cylinder shape, and then deep-fried until crisp. 
             Here, yuca dough envelops savory pork filling to make a traditional snack that’s 
             absolutely delicious!</p>

            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <h4>For The Filling</h4>
                <li>Heat oil in medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork. Cook, 
                    breaking up pork with wooden spoon, until no longer pink, 5-6 minutes; 
                    drain off and discard excess oil. Stir in olives, Sazón and Adobo. 
                    Cook, stirring until combined, about 1 minute more. Transfer 
                    pork mixture to bowl; transfer to refrigerator until chilled.</li>
                    
                <h4>For The Dough</h4>
                <li>In medium bowl, stir together yuca, Sazón and Adobo until combined;
                    set in refrigerator until chilled.</li>   
                    
                <h4>For The Fritters</h4>     
                <li>Scoop ¼ cup yuca mixture into palm of hand. Form into flat oval disk. 
                    Scoop 1 tbsp. cooled pork filling into center of dough. Fold dough
                     over filling to enclose; roll dough in hands to form cylinder about 3” long. 
                     Place on clean work surface; repeat with remaining dough and 
                     filling (you may have some pork left over), until you have 12 yuca cylinders.</li>
                     
                <h4>Frying</h4> 
                <li>Heat 2” oil in heavy, deep pot over medium-high heat until oil 
                    registers 350°F. Add 3-4 yuca cylinders, taking care not to crowd pan. Cook, 
                    flipping with slotted metal spoon, until outside of fritter is crisp and 
                    dough inside is cooked through (internal temperature of 165°F), 7-10 minutes. 
                    Transfer fritters to paper towel-lined plate to drain. Serve warm.</li>
