            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <li>2 cups of All Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp of baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of butter</li>
            <li>3/4 cup of brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>2 1/3 cups of mashed ripe bananas</li>

        <ol>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 
                a 9x5 inch loaf pan.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt. In a separate 
                    bowl, cream together butter and brown sugar. Stir in eggs and mashed 
                    bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; stir 
                    just to moisten. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.</li>
                    <li>Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted 
                        into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let bread cool in pan for 
                        10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack.</li>
