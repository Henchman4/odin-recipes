        <p>Borscht, also spelled borsch, borsht, or bortsch, beet soup of the Slavic 
            countries. Although borscht is important in Russian and Polish cuisines, Ukraine is 
            frequently cited as its place of origin. Its name is thought to be derived from 
            the Slavic word for the cow parsnip, or common hogweed (Heracleum sphondylium), or 
            from a fermented beverage derived from that plant. The more-palatable cultivated 
            beet eventually replaced the wild cow parsnip as the basis of the soup.

            Borschts are eaten hot or cold. Some are clear and light, others thick 
            and substantial. Many recipes counterbalance the sweetness of the beets with 
            the addition of kvass (also spelled kvas). The term kvass may refer to a sour, 
            slightly alcoholic beer made from bread or to a concoction of fermented beets; 
            both are used. Vinegar, lemon juice, or citric acid can be added to achieve 
            a similar effect.</p>
